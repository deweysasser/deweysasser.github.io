excerpt:  I've refreshed the site for 2021 using Jekyll
---

It's been a while since I set up the technology behind this site, and times have changed.

So, I'm moving it form Drupal to something else.

I'm trying out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to statically generate, and it's pretty cool.

I'm not sure if that's the right long term solution or not. We'll see. But, I
needed something now, and it's something.

If you have an option on what I should use (or, better yet, what features I should support), please
let me know.

Some thoughts are:
* discussions (could use disqus.com or commento.io)
* a more wiki-like structure with nice cross-links (probably dokuwiki)
