I'm getting into Docker, and have recently registered "deweysasser" as my docker hub username.  Neither my Github username nor my Twitter handle match this, so it's time to refactor handles.

Wherever possible I'm going to move to "DeweySasser".  Most of these services have some migration capability, so links, following, etc should automatically update.  If not, please update your bookmarks, etc.

Current usernames (this will be kept up to date):

* github:  dmsasser
* twitter: DeweyS
* StackExchange: dmsasser
