I gave my "Herding Cats..." talk at the 2017 New England VTUG Winter Warmer.

The talk covers technical, social and organizational issues for fast, agile development at large scale (~1k machines, 10ks of TPS, ~500TB transfer) in a cloud environment.

See the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/DeweySasser/herding-cats-in-the-cloud) on SlideShare.net.

In conjunction with this talk I was interviewed by Silicon Angle for theCube.  See the segment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyzv7jaSkOM&feature=youtu.be).
