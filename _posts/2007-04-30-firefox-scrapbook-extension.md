This week's tool:  the
[Scrap Book extension](http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/])for
FireFox.

Scrap Book is a combination of "save this web page" and an organizer
for saved web pages.  It captures *exactly* the state of the web page
as currently displayed to a disk cache and provides a FireFox side-bar
to browse or search your saved pages.

To view a page again you can click on it and you'll see it exactly as
you did the first time and with no further server interaction.  (Of
course, there's no guarantee that links to your shopping cart will
still be valid -- that's entirely up to the server.)

It organizes your saved pages in a standard tree view, allows you many
different kinds of search (including regular expression) and is
generally just very useful.

My most common use is to save order or receipt pages (you know, the
kind that say "print this out for your records?  Yeah, right, like I'm
going to print it out...)

I also use the folders to track what I've got on order vs. what I've
received, reimbursable expenses, agreements and licenses, etc, etc.
