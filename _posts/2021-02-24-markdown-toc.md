Introducing [Markdown Tables of Contents](https://github.com/deweysasser/markdown-doc).

This project contains a script and makefile to maintain a table of contents in your markdown
documents, along with an optional git `pre-commit` hook to keep it up to date.

I find it useful for either long documents or long READMEs for github projects.

```
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deweysasser/markdown-doc/main/README.md %}
```
