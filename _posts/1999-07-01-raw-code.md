"Raw Code", Lyrics by Dewey Sasser , with apologies to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dimitri+Piomkin">Dimitri Piomkin</a>

<verbatim>

Codin' Codin' Codin'
Keep those bugs from showin'
Got to keep on codin'
Raw Code!
Requirements are hidden
and salesmen keep on biddin
But still we'll ship this product when they say.
Got to keep on givin'
Money, stock and livin'
Are waitin' when I finish this day.

Code it up (Ship it out)
Ship it out (Code it up)
Code it up (Ship it out)
Raw Code!
Test it once (Build the kit)
Build the kit (Test it once)
Test it once (Build the kit)
Raw Code!

Keep movin' movin' movin'
Running, tweakin', tunin'
We think that we're improvin'
Raw Code!
The quarter's almost endin'
To customers we're sendin'
Whatever we have working at the time.
Specs that go on changing
We keep on rearranging
And yes of course we tested every line.

Server Crashed! (Start it up)
Log back in! (Re-submit)
Write it up! Save the log!
Raw Code!
Server Crashed! (What again?)
Boot it up. (Log back in.)
Server Crashed!  (Work around.)
Raw Code!
