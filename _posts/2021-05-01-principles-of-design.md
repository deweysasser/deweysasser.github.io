Some random thoughts on designing systems

* put the processing where the knowledge is, don't move the knowledge to the processing
* Where there's 2, there's N
* Be more general
* keep it in the problem space as long as possible
* Sufficiently detailed documentation is executable
* DRY is good
* always align authority and responsibility

(more will be added, along with explanations)
