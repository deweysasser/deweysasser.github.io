Something that often surprises people about a Software Architect[^1] role:  it's a people job.

Technical competence is table stakes.  

To actually play the game, it's all about communication, advocacy, communication, evangelism, communication, persuasion, communication, relationships, and communication.

There's no point in designing the perfect cat tree if you can't convince the cats to use it.
It's really about herding cats.

[^1]: same can be said about my current "Cloud Systems Architect" role.
